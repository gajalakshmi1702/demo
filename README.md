Hi Gajalakshmi,

Firstly, **I am very proud to be teaching you**. I knew your name even before I came to the class because I had already heard about your impressive cut-off score. I feel fortunate to have a student like you.

Don’t worry about being from a biology background—I will do my best to teach you everything step by step. And don’t feel bad about not knowing how to use a laptop; within a week of practice, you will handle it confidently.

I can understand your dream and the emotions in your message. What has happened is in the past, and now you are here in engineering. Believe me, with your determination, you will definitely become a very successful person in life. A cut-off of 197 is not a small thing—it shows your ability and hard work.

I promise to guide you as much as I can. If I continue in this college until you complete your four years, I am confident I will see you placed in a good company.

Never hesitate to contact me for any help—you can always reach out. Honestly, I feel very happy and proud to teach a student like you. Don’t be afraid of anything. You will surely shine, get a good job, and make your family proud.

All the very best!
